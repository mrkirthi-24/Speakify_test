# Speakify
The "Speakify" is a dynamic web scraping application that combines the power of NextJS(React), Flask, BeautifulSoup, and the Google Text-to-Speech API.

Key Features:

NextJS Frontend: The frontend of the "Speakify" is built using Next, providing a modern and responsive user interface. Users can input URLs, trigger the scraping process, and control the playback of the converted text.

Flask Backend: Flask serves as the backend, handling user requests and facilitating communication with the scraping component. It manages data flow between the frontend and the backend, ensuring a smooth user experience.

BeautifulSoup Web Scraping: BeautifulSoup, a Python library, is used for web scraping. It extracts content from Google seach results, cleaning and structuring the data for further processing. Users can select specific elements of a webpage to scrape, such as articles, blog posts, or other textual content.

Google Text-to-Speech API Integration: The project integrates the Google Text-to-Speech API to convert the scraped text into natural-sounding speech. Users can choose from different languages and voices for the audio output.
